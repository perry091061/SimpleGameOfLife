## General Info

## Testing:

Testing can be carried out using eclipse and using JUnit. The tests have
already been created and used, and can be found in SimpleGameOfLife/src/
 
I have included tests in JUnit to print out the board and glider, check the game loop ends of 20 iterations, and the game runs:

Test:

 * 1. To test the board displays and the glider
 * 2. To test the game loop count
 * 3. To test the start parameter for the game loop.
